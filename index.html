        <h3>
          Copyright explained in a minute
        </h3>
        <br />
        <div class='build'>
          <p>
            'Modern' Copyright starts with the Statute of Anne in the year 1710.
          </p>
          <p>
            The original aim of Copyright was to effectively subsidise the rather expensive cost of printing literary works, by offering the author and their publishers temporary monopoly over their works in return for it becoming public domain at a later date.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in the last century or so publishers have sought to take advantage of copyright by continually expanding the term of copyright. Critics of this process (particularly in the US) tend to refer to this practice as the 'Mickey Mouse Law', as copyright extension proposals typically turned up when the copyright on Disney's early works was set to expire.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, the role of copyright is now becoming controversial, as the advent and growth of the internet remove most of the original and valid benefits of copyright, which has in turn lead to the increase in popularity of FOSS and Open Culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Berne Convention of 1886, which is still enforced throughout the majority of the globe, extended the power of copyright, meaning that copyright was universal and automatically applied to all new works at the time of creation. 
            <strong>We'll talk about the impact of this shortly.</strong>

          So what does Copyright have to do with Licensing?

        <h3>
          The Need for Licensing
        </h3>
        <br />
        <ul class='build'>
          <li>
            Thanks to the Berne Convention, all code you write is automatically protected by copyright law.
          </li>
          <li>
            This protection must be signed away by waiver (such as your employment contract) or licensed in order to allow others to use it
          </li>
          <li>
            Open Source licenses waive some of your copyright protections, but usually come with conditions, like no commercial usage or requiring attribution.
          </li>
          <li>
            'Open source' code doesn't really count as 'free' (FOSS) unless it's licensed with an open source license.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          So how should I license my software?
        </h3>
        <br />
        <div class='build'>
          <p>
            First, figure out what restrictions, if any, you'll place on your software. As a general rule though, if you don't allow people to share it in some form, it's not really open source. It's usually better to be as permissive as you feel comfortable with, as it's more likely to get your code used
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than writing your own license, it may be worth using one of the many existing licensing packs available.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good example of a pre-built generic license are the Creative Commons licenses. They're not really designed for software, but have the benefit of high granularity and that they supply their licenses in both a human readable form and the legalese that might be required in a court of law. They also have CC0 which is effectively a Public Domain license.
